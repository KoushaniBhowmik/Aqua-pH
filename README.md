# Aqua-pH
Introduction:
The Aqua pH Monitor is an innovative IoT-based hardware project designed to measure and monitor the pH levels of various liquid samples. Whether used in industrial settings, homes, aquariums, or swimming pools, this device offers a cost-effective and user-friendly solution for ensuring the optimal pH balance of liquids. The Aqua pH Monitor is versatile, reliable, and provides real-time data that can be accessed remotely, making it a valuable tool for maintaining the safety and quality of liquids in various environments.


Key Features:
1.Cost-Effective and Handy Design: The Aqua pH Monitor is designed to be affordable and portable, making it accessible for a wide range of applications without compromising on performance.
2.Versatile Applications: The device can be used in multiple environments, including industrial processes, home water systems, aquariums, and swimming pools, providing accurate pH measurements across different settings.
3.Real-Time Monitoring:Equipped with IoT capabilities, the Aqua pH Monitor allows users to track pH levels in real time, ensuring immediate detection of any fluctuations that could affect liquid quality.
4.Remote Data Access:Through its IoT integration, users can access pH data remotely via a smartphone or computer, enabling convenient monitoring and management from anywhere.
5.Alert System:The monitor can be programmed to send alerts if the pH levels deviate from the desired range, helping users take prompt action to correct any issues.


How It Works:
The Aqua pH Monitor operates by using a pH sensor that is immersed in the liquid sample to measure the acidity or alkalinity of the solution. The sensor collects data on the pH level and transmits this information to a microcontroller, which processes the data and sends it to the cloud through an IoT module. Users can then access this data in real-time via a web interface or mobile app.
The system can be customized to monitor specific pH ranges depending on the application, and it can trigger alerts if the pH level falls outside the preset range. This ensures that users can maintain the ideal pH balance in their liquid environments, whether they are managing a swimming pool, ensuring water quality in an aquarium, or monitoring industrial processes.

Components:
1. Arduino UNO & USB Cable.
2. LCD Display & I2C module.
3. pH sensor & ph probe.
4. Jumper wires.
